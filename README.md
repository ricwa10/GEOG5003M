# GEOG5003M
- This folder contains a list of the practicals of the GEOG5003M Programming for Geographical Information Analysis module.
- The nine practical are structure by week (1-9):
  1. Data variables: some basic code knowledge.
  2. Containers: putting our agents in containers and functions for working with numbers in containers.
  3. Control flow: using control flow statements to remove all the repeats.
  4. Functions: building some functions into our system.
  5. Classes and objects: converting the code into an object oriented version and encapsulating agents' properties and behaviour. 
  6. Input/Output: importing some raster data to use as our agents' environment, and get them to interact with it. 
  7. Communication: getting agents talking to each other by altering each other's variables.
  8. Matplotlib: extra functions of matplotlib, get it animated.
  9. Build your own: giving it a Graphical User Interface (GUI), and load some data into it from the web.
- Each practical builds upon the previous one.
- The final outcome (Week 9) is a simple agent-based model (ABM).
- There are two python files in the last outcome (model and agentframework), the user should open both but run the first one.
